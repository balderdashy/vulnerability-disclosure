###Security Vulnerability Disclosure

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in Sails, Waterline, or one of the core modules of Sails, please send an email to vulnerabilities@sails.org.  __Please don't file a public issue__.

#####What should be included in the email?

- Identify the module where you found the security vulnerability (e.g. Sails, Waterline, other core module).
- A summary of the vulnerability
- The code you used when you discovered the vulnerability or a code example of the vulnerability (whichever is shorter).
- Whether you want us to make your involvement public.  If you want such a reference the name and link you wish to be referred (e.g. jane doe's link to her github account)

#####The Process
When you report a vulnerability, one of the project members will respond to you within a maximum of xx days.  This response will most likely be an acknowledgement that we've received the report and will be investigating it immediately.

Based upon the amount of time it will take to fix the vulnerability we'll either send out a patch that disables the feature with the vulnerability or provide an estimate of the time it will take to fix.

You can expect follow-up emails outlining the progression of a solution to the vulnerability along with any other questions we may have regarding your experience.

When a solution is achieved we do the following:
- notify you,
- release a patch on the module's main repo
- provide a link to the patch here along with an explanation of it's origin and crediting you (if you have chosen to be identified)
- publicize the release via our various mailing lists.
